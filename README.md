## Focus

My work centers on studying how data-driven and intelligent systems behave in practice.

I approach problems by designing systems, running controlled experiments, analyzing results, and documenting both successes and failures. I am especially interested in questions that require careful investigation rather than quick demos or surface-level outcomes.

## Research Approach

All work under this account is organized as project-based research repositories.

Each project typically includes:
- a clearly defined research question  
- system design and implementation  
- experiments and analysis  
- documentation of results, limitations, and failures  

The goal is not just to build models, but to understand *why systems behave the way they do*.
