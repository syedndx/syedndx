## Focus

My work centers on systems, experiments, and research.  
I study how data-driven and intelligent systems behave in practice by designing systems, running experiments, and analyzing results.

I am interested in questions that require careful investigation rather than quick demos or surface-level outcomes.

## Research Work

All research work is organized as project-based repositories under this account.

Each project typically includes:
- a clearly defined research question
- system design and implementation
- experiments and analysis
- documentation of results and limitations

Projects are added as the work develops.
